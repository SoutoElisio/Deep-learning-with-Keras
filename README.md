# Deep-learning-with-Keras
This project builds, trains, and evaluates a regression model to predict concrete strength. It compares different methods: using original values, normalizing predictors, varying epochs, and rigorous evaluation. The code includes data preprocessing, a neural network model with three hidden layers, and repeated training and evaluation.
